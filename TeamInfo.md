## Project Summary

The Classroom Management System (CMS) - Illini CMS represents a sophisticated platform tailored to meet the diverse needs of educational institutions, teachers, students, and parents. By centralizing classroom management tasks and facilitating seamless communication among stakeholders, the CMS streamlines administrative processes and enhances the teaching and learning experience. Administrators wield powerful tools for user management and system configuration, ensuring secure access and customization to suit the unique requirements of their educational environment. Teachers benefit from a comprehensive suite of features designed to optimize instructional workflows, from creating and managing classrooms to marking attendance and uploading class videos. The CMS also fosters transparent communication between teachers and students, enabling the sharing of live Zoom links and assignment submissions via Google Forms. Additionally, the system empowers teachers to track student progress effectively through visualizations, enabling them to identify trends, provide targeted support, and celebrate student achievements.

Parents are integral beneficiaries of the CMS, gaining access to a wealth of information and resources related to their child's academic journey. Through the system, parents receive timely notifications for student absences, enabling them to stay informed and engaged in their child's educational progress. Moreover, parents can access historical attendance records, review student grades and academic performance, and explore visualizations depicting their child's progress over time. This transparency and accessibility empower parents to participate in their child's education actively, fostering a collaborative partnership between home and school that supports student success. Overall, the Classroom Management System simplifies administrative tasks, enhances communication within educational institutions, and strengthens the connection between teachers, students, and parents, ultimately fostering a supportive and enriching learning environment.
